# Recipe Cookbook

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/briangarvey/briangarvey/_apis/build/status/stonesbg.recipe_cookbook?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/briangarvey/briangarvey/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

This is a collection of recipes that have been used over the years and want to eventually create my own family cookbook out of the collection.

The recipe cookbook site is built using vuepress which is a minimalist static site generator based off of Vue.js.

The deployment process is built using Azure Pipelines which pushes the statically built site to Azure Storage Blobs.  This in turn uses the new static site functionality as part of blob storage.
