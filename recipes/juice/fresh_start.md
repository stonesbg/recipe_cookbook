# Fresh Start

This juice recipe is great to start with for those who are trying to ease themselves into this whole juicing thing and they're not quite ready to drink those deep coloured looking juices. If you need it even sweeter, just add another apple to it.

Don't think that just because it's said to be a "beginner juice" means it's not as good for you, this juice is great for you!
