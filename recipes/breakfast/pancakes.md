# Pancakes

## Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 ½ tsp baking powder
* ½ tsp salt
* 1 egg, beaten lightly
* 1 ½ cups milk
* 2 tbsp butter, melted

## Method

Sift together first three ingredients (to prevent lumps). In a separate bowl, mix egg and milk, then add it to flour mix, stirring until just smooth. Then stir in butter. If you want to mix it up, throw in blueberries, a tiny dice of apple, or bits of banana. Grease a griddle or non stick pan with cooking spray or a little vegetable oil. Heat pan on medium for about ten minutes. Pour batter to form pancakes of whatever size you like. Cook first side until bubbles form on top, about three minutes; then flip and cook other side until it, too, is brown, about two minutes. Serve immediately with butter and syrup or hold briefly in warm oven. Serves four.
