# Southern Skillet Cornbread

## Ingredients

* 4 tablespoons melted lard or bacon grease
* 2 cups good-quality coarse-ground yellow cornmeal, such as McEwen & Sons or Anson Mills
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1 1/2 cups buttermilk

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
1. Put 2 tablespoons of the lard or grease in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Put the skillet in the oven to preheat.
1. In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk the eggs, buttermilk, and the remaining 2 tablespoons lard together, mixing well to combine. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring just until incorporated. Do not overmix.
1. Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven and swirl the melted fat to coat the bottom and sides. Pour the batter into the pan and return it to the oven to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the bread is golden on top and has pulled away from sides of the pan slightly. (A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean.) Slice and serve.
