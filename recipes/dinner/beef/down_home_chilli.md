# Down Home Chilli

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
* 2 cups chopped yellow onions
* 1 tablespoon minced garlic
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon Emeril's Original Essence
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1 (15-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
* 3 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 cups water

## Method

In a heavy 6-quart pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the meat and stir with a
large wooden spoon to break up the meat. Cook, stirring, until the meat is brown and
cooked through, 5 minutes. Add the onions, garlic, chili powder, essence, salt, cumin,
and black pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, 4 minutes. Add the tomatoes,
tomato paste, sugar, and water. Stir well and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to
medium-low and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. Keep warm until ready to serve.Â
